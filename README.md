# Information Bottleneck as Regularizer for Decision Trees

This repository is a proof-of-concept implementation of decision trees trained with the loss function proposed in [The Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057.pdf), and [a presentation](slides/main.pdf) about it. The idea andthe usage of the code are also explained in [the notebook](ib_trees.ipynb).

This is my project for the the lecture *Information Theory* of Prof. Caire at TU Berlin, so thank you for the patience!
