\frametitle{Information Bottleneck in Decision Trees}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item plug in $J_{IB;\beta}$ into decision tree inducer
        \item time and space complexity of the algorithm not affected
        \item IB now applicable to samples, when $P_{\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y}}$ unkown
        \item Generalization bounds?
        \item some authors also train neural networks with the IB objective, but this is a much harder task: $I(\mathbb{X}, \hat{X})$ and $I(\hat{X}, \mathbb{Y})$ are hard to estimate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Information Dropout \cite{achille_information_2017}: add multiplicative noise to intermediate activations
            \item MINE \cite{belghazi_mine_2018}: general purpose estimator for mututal information using neural networks, which can then be used to train another network with the IB objective
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
