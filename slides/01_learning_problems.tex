\frametitle{Learning Problems: Classification and Regression}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y}$ be random variables with an unknown joint probability distribution $P_{\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y}}$, $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}$ their domain and $X \in \mathbb{X}^N, Y \in \mathbb{Y}^N$ be observed samples. Finding a function $f$ such that $E_{\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y}}[J(f(\mathbb{X}), \mathbb{Y})]$ is small is called a classification or regression problem. \footnote{
        This definition can be seen as a special case of the definition by \cite{mitchell_machine_1997}: "A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance in task $T$. measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$."
    }
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Classification: $|\mathcal{Y}| \in \mathbb{N}$ - the target variable represents a category
    \item Regression: $|\mathcal{Y}| \in \mathbb{R}^{D_y}$ - the target can be any vector
    \item Example: Predict if an image shows a cat, predict the age of a person shown in an image.
\end{itemize}
